### 1. R(t+1) Evolution - Intuition/Interaction Model
**Plain Text:**
```
R(t+1) = (t/T)[α(t)·f_Intuition(A) + β(t)·f_Interaction(A,B)] + (1 - t/T)[γ(t)·f_Alignment(R(t), P_Proto-Axiom)]
```

**LaTeX:**
```latex
R(t+1) = \frac{t}{T} \left[ \alpha(t) \cdot f_{\text{Intuition}}(A) + \beta(t) \cdot f_{\text{Interaction}}(A,B) \right] + \left(1 - \frac{t}{T}\right) \left[ \gamma(t) \cdot f_{\text{Alignment}}(R(t), P_{\text{Proto-Axiom}}) \right]
```

**Description:**
Temporal evolution of the Resultant (R) incorporating observer intuition and interaction with dualistic assonances. The equation balances intuition-driven dynamics (early time dominance, t/T ≈ 1) with alignment to the Proto-Axiom (late time, t/T ≈ 0).

## FORCE UNIFICATION MECHANISM

The documents propose unification via:
1. **Perception (P) as Inverse Latency (L)**: P = k/L
2. **Observer Integration**: Through time-dependent evolutionary functions
3. **Dimensional Entropy Reduction**: Via latency minimization on angular momentum moment
4. **Duality Resolution**: Via singularity/dipole switching in D-ND model
5. **Proto-Axiomatic Alignment**: Via f₃ autologous alignment to fundamental principles

This represents an alternative to standard Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) and supersymmetry approaches, based on observer state and perception-latency dynamics.
